# Introduction

React project made as a final project delivery in the Coderhouse React course.

The main idea of the project was to create a simple, minimalist, but very nice e-commerce page where people can buy their peripherals in a very easy and comfortable way from the comfort of their home.



# How did you make this project?

In this project I made use of multiple tools, such as:

  - Simple and advanced Hooks
  - Libraries such as Bootstrap
  - Other technologies such as Firebase as Database
  - CSS
  - JavaScript / jQuery
  - Git
  - And more!

This project was deployed to the GitHub page thanks to the installation of "gh-pages" in CMD.



# Can I see your uploaded project?
