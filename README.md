React project made as a final project delivery in the Coderhouse React course.

In this project I made use of multiple tools, such as:

  · Simple and advanced Hooks
  · Libraries such as Bootstrap
  · Other technologies such as Firebase as Database
  · CSS
  · JavaScript / jQuery
  · Git
  · And more!

This project was deployed to the GitHub page thanks to the installation of "gh-pages" in CMD.
